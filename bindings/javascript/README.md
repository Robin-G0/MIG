# Motion Input Grid (MIG) browser package

[English](README.md) | [Français](README.fr.md)

Recognize movements in the browser with the C++ engine compiled to WASM.
`MIGSession` owns the camera, models and tracker; React and Vue adapters connect
that session to your components. Next.js uses the React adapter.

## Install from npm

In your application (Node.js 22.12+), run:

```sh
npm install motion-input-grid
npx mig-copy-assets public/mig
```

The package includes WASM, models, MediaPipe, types and licenses. Serve
`public/mig` at `/mig/` over localhost or HTTPS. React and Vue use this
same package; Next.js uses the React adapter. Install your chosen framework
in your application.

```js
import { MIGSession } from 'motion-input-grid';
import { useMIG } from 'motion-input-grid/react'; // React / Next.js
// import { useMIG } from 'motion-input-grid/vue'; // Vue
```

Use only the import matching your application. In PowerShell, use
`npm.cmd` and `npx.cmd` if the execution policy blocks `.ps1` scripts.

`motion-input-grid` provides a browser camera session, React hook and Vue
composable backed by the existing C++/WASM engine. React and Vue are optional
peer dependencies; Next.js uses the React adapter.

## Use the package

Pass the public asset URL to `useMIG` or `MIGSession`. The default is `/mig/`;
applications hosted under a subpath should pass their actual URL. Keep all runtime
files together. The camera opens only after `start(video, canvas)` or the example's
Start button. Serve over localhost or HTTPS.

Add these elements to your page and the JavaScript to your application's
bundled module. Start loads the supplied demo profile. To use your own profile,
call `await session.importJSON(jsonText)` from your file picker; invalid JSON
rejects the promise without replacing the active profile. Place video and canvas
in one container to overlay the preview, and mirror that container once.
The framework examples include the complete CSS and controls.

```html
<button id="start">Start</button>
<button id="stop">Stop</button>
<p id="status"></p>
<video id="camera" muted playsinline></video>
<canvas id="overlay"></canvas>
```

```js
import { MIGSession } from 'motion-input-grid';

const video = document.querySelector('#camera');
const canvas = document.querySelector('#overlay');
const status = document.querySelector('#status');
const session = new MIGSession({
    assetBase: new URL('/mig/', location.href).href,
    onAction: ({ action, id }) => console.log(action, id)
});
const unsubscribe = session.subscribe(state => { status.textContent = state.status; });
document.querySelector('#start').onclick = () => {
    session.start(video, canvas).catch(error => { status.textContent = error.message; });
};
document.querySelector('#stop').onclick = () => session.stop();
window.addEventListener('pagehide', () => {
    unsubscribe();
    session.dispose();
}, { once: true });
```

`subscribe` immediately supplies a snapshot, then receives status changes and
accepted actions. The action list holds the most recent accepted frame, including
simultaneous events; it is feedback rather than live held-state information.
`stop` releases the camera and resets recognition, retaining models for restart.
`dispose` also closes models and the engine. It is idempotent. Failed profile
validation leaves the active configuration intact. `recalibrate` resets progress.
The session's optional `onFrame(session)` callback reads `coordinate(index,
system)` for imperative animation/XYZ feedback without reactive updates; system
0 is normalized image XYZ, 1 world metres, 2 world metres with Y up. Missing
coordinates return `null`. Keep callbacks short to avoid delaying inference.

React exports `useMIG` from `motion-input-grid/react`. Attach its `video` and
`canvas` refs and bind `start`, `stop`, `recalibrate`, `importJSON`. Vue exports the
same operations from `motion-input-grid/vue` and a shallow `state` ref. React
options `assetBase`/`profileMode` recreate the session when changed; Vue options
are fixed for that component's lifetime. Both dispose on unmount/page exit.
`onAction` receives `{ action, id }`; use it for your application's commands.

Inference stays outside reactive state. Only new video frames are processed,
hand inference follows `tracking.hands`, and coordinates are mirrored only by
the preview's CSS. No desktop keyboard injection occurs. MediaPipe Tasks Vision
0.10.35 is included in `runtime/vision` and copied with the other public assets.
Start loads local files; no CDN request or consumer dependency installation is needed.

and [Next.js](https://github.com/Robin-G0/MIG/blob/main/examples/next/README.md) examples and the

## Alternative: build the package

Build the WASM engine first, then run from the full checkout:

```sh
npm ci
npm run prepare:javascript
npm pack --workspace motion-input-grid --pack-destination build/releases
```

The tarball includes WASM, model files, runtime modules, declarations and licenses.
Install that local tarball into your application, then copy its runtime assets:

```sh
npm install /path/to/motion-input-grid-1.0.2.tgz
npx --package motion-input-grid mig-copy-assets public/mig
```
