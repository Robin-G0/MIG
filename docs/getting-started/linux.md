# Linux configurator and controller

[English](linux.md) | [Français](linux.fr.md)

> [!NOTE]
> On Debian, the configurator, controller and some native examples are still
> being developed and tested. They may not yet work fully.

To use prebuilt applications, follow the [configurator](../guides/configurator.md)
and [controller](../guides/controller.md) guides. This page covers source builds
and platform-specific controls. For just a library, see the [C++ SDK / CMake](cpp.md),
[Python](../../bindings/python/README.md) or [JavaScript](../../bindings/javascript/README.md) guide.

Both `mig-configurator` and `mig-controller` build as native Qt6 applications,
sharing the existing engine, estimator and schema-v2 profiles with Windows.

The controller has a dedicated profile/bindings interface. See the
[controller guide](../guides/controller.md) for import, remembered selection, compact mode
and verification. The drawing tools described below belong to the configurator.

```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build g++ python3 qt6-base-dev libxtst-dev libegl1 libgles2
python3 tools/bootstrap-native-linux.py
cmake -S . -B build/linux-apps -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/linux-apps --parallel 3
ctest --test-dir build/linux-apps --output-on-failure
build/linux-apps/bin/mig-configurator --runtime "$PWD/build/native-linux-deps"
build/linux-apps/bin/mig-controller --runtime "$PWD/build/native-linux-deps" --config configs/default.json
```

Use `bash tools/build-linux.sh [build-directory] [ON|OFF]` to bootstrap/build/test
both applications after installing the prerequisites above.

Source builds are tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 x86-64. Official MediaPipe requires
glibc >=2.28; packaged applications require glibc >=2.35. Source builds use system
Qt/X11; release archives bundle their shared dependencies/plugins/fonts. See
[release preparation](../development/packaging.md) for x64 archives and ARM64 positions SDKs.
Use `--camera N` for `/dev/videoN`;
single-plane YUYV V4L2 and camera permissions are required. Start explicitly opens
capture; stop one application before starting the other.

The sidebar has input settings, colored drawing, body selection, order,
Interaction sign/0..60000 ms hold and explicit layer reassignment. Draw in Full grid;
Body view fits the complete mirrored image. View toggles grid, dots/hands, logs and
light/dark themes. Input settings edit keys/sequences, Mirror, Single/Hold/Repeat,
repeat interval and cooldown. Save validates atomically. Pro edits all schema-v2
fields through a complete-profile JSON editor, preserving scoped fingers, stages,
tolerance, controls and recordings.

The Linux visual frontend has fewer tools than Win32: advanced region/step/finger
editing uses JSON; interactive recording/trace review, bucket/tolerance tools and
Undo/Redo are not yet ported. Existing profiles keep all settings and recognition
uses the same engine. Global Restart/Recalibrate signs work; RecordToggle needs
the future recording UI. These are frontend limits, not removed profile fields.

One worker owns camera/models/engine/controls. A mutex-protected latest snapshot
transfers copied observations/image and at most 64 timestamped events. Profile
changes stop/join before replacement; stale events/output are rejected after 250 ms.
Shutdown joins the worker and releases keys. Widgets stay on the main thread per
[Qt's threading contract](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/threads-qobject.html).

Keyboard is opt-in X11/XTest; native Wayland output is disabled. Letters/digits,
function keys, modifiers/navigation and named key-editor keys are supported. Text
uses characters present in the current X11 layout; unsupported/non-BMP characters
disable output with an error. Full Windows Unicode delivery is not available on
this backend. Hold/Repeat reuse the existing scheduler.

Offscreen `--ui-test` checks both executables without camera access. Physical V4L2,
keyboard delivery and human gesture accuracy still require desktop validation.
