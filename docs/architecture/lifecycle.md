# Current execution pipeline

[English](lifecycle.md) | [Français](lifecycle.fr.md)

This page describes implemented ownership. [Architecture](overview.md)
describes module boundaries; [performance](performance.md) separates measured
recognition costs from native estimation and UI work.

## Build artifacts

`MIG::core` and `MIG::format` are portable C++ static libraries. Optional
`MIG::hands` supplies geometry, `MIG::native` supplies camera/estimation and
`MIG::face` is only a scaffold. `MIG::c` builds `mig-c.dll`/`libmig-c.so.1` for
serialized language consumers. Windows apps are Win32/GDI; Linux apps are Qt6.
The official `libmediapipe.dll`/`.so` is loaded by absolute path. Pinned Lite/Full
pose models and optional hand model live beside packaged runtimes.
Apps default to Lite, native Pose defaults to Full; both estimate 33 body joints.

## Windows live path

```text
Media Foundation capture, timestamp mapped to monotonic clock
  -> reused RGB/BGRX buffers, four ref-counted leases
  -> latest-frame mailbox, wake inference owner
  -> pose + explicitly requested hands on the same image/time
  -> bounded portable observation conversion
  -> freshness, calibration, compiled constraints, arbitration
  -> immutable revision-tagged snapshot + bounded accepted events
  -> UI drawing and opt-in Single/Hold/Repeat output scheduler
```

The main preview reads latest capture independently. Last-reader release under
a mutex prevents buffer reuse while inference or drawing reads it. Pool state
survives leases at shutdown. Native task results/snapshots may allocate; only
the compiled engine's update path is allocation-free in the regression workload.
Profile/capability/calibration revisions discard in-flight old results.
No unbounded frame backlog or UI inference loop is used.

## Linux and integrated hosts

Linux's worker owns synchronous V4L2 capture, tasks, engine and commands. It
publishes copied latest images/observations and at most 64 timestamped events.
Profile changes stop/join before replacement. UI widgets stay on the main thread.
Single-plane YUYV capture negotiates modes up to 720p and uses bounded poll waits.

Positions hosts supply fresh unmirrored packets without models/camera. Native
hosts optionally estimate RGB or poll capture. `CaptureRuntime` balances Windows
COM/Media Foundation ownership. ABI capture start/poll/stop/destroy stays on one
owner thread; successful import stops it, invalid import preserves it. A poll
already recognizes its packet; preview pixels expire at the next poll.
Python viewers copy pixels/events before publishing to a worker mailbox.

Browser sessions own models, WASM, stream and cancellation generations. Start
requests capture; Stop releases tracks; Dispose releases all resources. Work is
performed once per fresh video frame. React/Vue state receives status/actions,
not landmark arrays; Next's SSR never opens browser resources.

## Recognition, capability and output

The 27x27 grid preserves anchor [4.5,3.5], scales each cell to 20% current shoulder
width and uses a 35 ms filter. Body/Calibrated normal/mirror projections are fixed
engine storage. Preview mirrors once; input Mirror independently swaps anatomy.
Body depth and hand depth retain separate origins and optional metric coordinates.

Both apps restore `tracking.hands` from the profile. Explicit UI requests and
applying finger/gesture bindings enable it; integrated Pose requires
`set_hands_enabled(true)`. False means no hand task creation/inference, not merely
hidden bones. OFF builds reject unsupported hand packets/requests.

Recognition evaluates inputs before global commands. Occupied Interaction cells
with matching signs reserve that hand from commands. Interaction-only holds and
commands permit 500 ms observation gaps; paths/sweeps permit 180 ms. Native
recognition/output freshness is 250 ms; command results are limited to 500 ms.
The engine emits one accepted event and updates independent live terminal state.

ActionOutput serializes transient sequences, owns terminal Hold chords with key
reference counts and repeats without queued overlap/catch-up bursts. Text waits
for foreign modifiers to release. The user explicitly enables output. Windows
Unicode uses SendInput; Linux XTest uses the current X11 layout, no native Wayland.
Test, dialogs, Stop, reset, lost conditions and stale data cancel/release output.
SDKs provide logical events and active state; they never inject desktop keys.

## Shutdown and verification

Stop wakes/cancels capture, joins owners and releases tasks, buffers and output.
An opaque upstream inference call must return before join; it has no application
cancellation guarantee. JSON reads are bounded to 1 MiB/depth 32 and save uses
isolated same-directory staging with atomic replacement.

CTest covers semantics, conversion, capabilities, leases and blank-frame native
lifecycles. Browser/GUI tests use synthetic observations. ASan/UBSan covers the
portable build. None proves real camera accuracy or third-party leak freedom.
MIG does not record/upload frames, but upstream telemetry connections have been
observed. Local browser assets remove CDN loading, not every possible upstream
network attempt. Remaining hardware/editor checks are in
[release preparation](../reference/support.md).
