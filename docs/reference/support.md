# Support and maturity

[English](support.md) | [Français](support.fr.md)

This is the canonical support matrix for MIG 1.0.0, JSON schema 2 and C ABI 1.
A maturity label describes the interface, not the quality of a particular camera.
Automated synthetic and blank-frame checks cannot establish hardware compatibility.

| Component | Maturity | Evidence | Targets | Scope / limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core / C++ SDK | Stable | Tested | Windows x64, Linux x64/ARM64 | CTest, installed CMake consumer; ARM64 emulated |
| C ABI 1 / schema 2 | Stable | Tested | Same SDK targets | Packet layout, strict imports, recognition and lifecycle fixtures |
| Python ctypes | Beta | Tested | Windows x64, Linux x64/ARM64 | Installed self-contained wheels; Linux glibc 2.35+ |
| JavaScript / WASM | Beta | Tested | Modern desktop browsers | npm installation, native WASM and synthetic browser/lifecycle tests |
| .NET binding | Beta | Tested | Windows/Linux x64 | Managed bridge against extracted C ABI; engine editor tests are separate |
| vcpkg | Beta | Tested | Windows/Linux x64 | Generated overlay installation and external consumer |
| Debian / APT tooling | Beta | Tested | amd64; arm64 package generated | amd64 installation; signed test repository update/download |
| Native capture / desktop apps | Beta | Tested | Windows/Linux x64 | Blank-frame and synthetic/UI tests; real camera/key delivery untested |
| Godot add-on | Preview | Tested | Godot 4.3, Windows x64, Linux x64/ARM64 | Fresh-project imports and GDScript lifecycle; no exported-game validation |
| Unity UPM | Preview | Untested in editor | Windows/Linux x64 | Native/.NET payload tested; editor/player builds not run |
| Unreal plugin | Preview | Untested in editor | Windows x64, Linux x64/ARM64 payloads | C ABI payload tested; module/game builds not run |
| Face scaffold | Experimental | Untested | Portable source | No face estimator or supported face recognition product |
| Real cameras, OS key delivery, physical ARM64 | — | Untested | Target-dependent | Hardware/manual tests required |
| macOS, mobile engine plugins | Planned | Untested | No distributed binaries | No support claim |

## Labels

- **Stable**: public contracts exercised by regression and installed-consumer tests;
  changes follow the documented API/ABI/schema contract.
- **Beta**: usable interface with automated validation and remaining deployment checks.
- **Preview**: integration for evaluation; editor versions, exports and installation
  need broader manual validation before stabilization.
- **Experimental**: incomplete or exploratory functionality without a support guarantee.
- **Tested**: the stated check actually ran; it covers only its stated environment.
- **Untested**: the relevant check has not run.
- **Expected to work**: an inference from compatible prerequisites, never test evidence.
- **Planned**: no delivered support. Roadmap entries are not commitments.

Windows native binaries need a compatible Visual C++ runtime. Linux targets glibc
2.35+; native Linux keyboard output uses X11/XTest, not Wayland injection. The
pinned MediaPipe estimator is supplied for x64. ARM64 SDKs accept host landmarks;
there is no Linux ARM64 camera runtime or Windows ARM64 binary in this release.
Editor packages do not include a camera provider.

See [quick start](../getting-started/bootstrap.md), [architecture](../architecture/overview.md)
and [package contents](../development/distribution.md). Hardware validation should
cover integrated/USB webcams, resolutions and frame rates, CPUs/GPUs, camera
start/stop, missing/stale frames and held-key release on each target system.
