The standalone camera examples use
[`raised-hands.json`](../../examples/common/raised-hands.json): separate left/right
wrist inputs in body space, with four full-width green Required rows followed by
a yellow Trigger row. Each `[x,y,width,height]` region is a horizontal strip;
numbered ordered rows require an upward path, rather than a Python height check.
Hand inference is enabled for the finger overlay, but no finger sign is required
to raise a wrist. These examples emit logical events and bind no keyboard keys.

Only schema version 2 is accepted. Older versions and legacy_path fields are rejected;
there is no migration or legacy recognition engine. Unknown versions and fields fail
before replacing the active document.
`load_configuration(path)` and `parse_configuration(json_text)` use the same strict
validator and 1 MiB / 32-level limits. `serialize_configuration(config)` exports the
same v2 document without filesystem access; `save_configuration` uses it for atomic
file replacement. On Windows, temporary sharing/locking conflicts are retried for
up to 500 ms. Persistent failures preserve the saved profile and report the OS error.
Native and WebAssembly consumers import configurator profiles
without migration or a separate JavaScript schema. Failed web imports retain the
current engine. See [integration examples](../integrations/overview.md).

Linux Qt applications, Python ctypes and Unity/Godot/Unreal C ABI consumers use
this same schema-v2 parser/engine. No language-specific JSON format was added.
Runtime packets/handles and keyboard/window consent are not serialized. Successful
C ABI imports stop capture; invalid imports preserve it. Linux Pro edits all fields
through its complete-profile editor. See [C ABI](c-abi.md) and [Linux UI limits](../getting-started/linux.md).

## Document and coordinate system

Root fields are `schema_version: 2`, required `inputs` (0..64), optional
`tracking: {"hands": false}`, and optional `controls`. Both applications use this
same persisted Hands switch, including after loading and undoing a profile. Applying
hand gesture bindings or an input with finger rules enables it in hands-enabled builds.
Finger rules require hand observations;
missing observations never silently bypass a configured rule.

Each input requires stable `id`, display `name`, and logical `action`. Optional
fields are `keyboard` (an ordered array of text/chord actions; omitted or empty
means logical event only), `mirror`
(false), `space` (`calibrated`, default, or `body`), `max_duration_ms` (0..10000,
default 0: no time limit), `cooldown_ms` (0..10000, default 0: no cooldown),
whole-movement `constraints` and `fingers`, ordered `steps`, reviewed
`recordings`, `action_mode` (`single_press`, default, `hold`, `repeat`) and
`repeat_interval_ms` (20..60000, default 200).

Cooldown starts when this input fires and suppresses both its normal and mirrored
variants until the deadline. It does not replace the release/rearm latch: holding
a completed movement still cannot emit additional recognition events. Repeat mode
replays keyboard output from the accepted live activation independently of cooldown.
Restart clears this runtime
deadline. An explicit positive time limit remains available in Pro mode and starts
when an attempt begins. Newly authored inputs have no movement time limit.
The global hand-command recovery delay remains separate and fixed at 1000 ms.

`keyboard` contains up to 256 objects, each with exactly one of `text` (UTF-8)
or `keys` (1..255 unique Windows virtual keys, each 1..255). The former eight-key
limit is removed. Keys may repeat across successive objects, but repeating a key
inside one simultaneous chord is invalid. Text totals at most 16384 UTF-8 bytes;
invalid UTF-8 and NUL are rejected. An empty text object is a no-op.

```json
"keyboard": [
  {"text": "Hello world"},
  {"keys": [13]},
  {"keys": [17, 67]},
  {"keys": [67]},
  {"keys": [67]}
]
```

Both apps execute this sequence in the foreground application when **Keyboard: On**.
Text uses Windows Unicode input; chords press modifiers first and release keys in
reverse order after 80 ms in Single press. Actions have a 20 ms separation. Accepted
sequences run serially (up to 16 queued per input); terminal Hold shortcuts can coexist.
Shared keys use ownership counts, so releasing one input never releases another's
modifier. Text waits while another action owns a modifier, preventing it from
affecting later text.
Text is dispatched in small batches without blocking capture or the UI.
Stop, reset, disabling output, stale tracking, modal dialogs, the keyboard editor
and Test cancel pending sequences and release output. Test never sends keys.
Keyboard consent and View overlays are UI state, not persisted profile fields.

The **Keys / Ctrl+K** field and **Edit keys** window accept:

- `"Hello world" _ Enter`: type the quoted text, then press Enter.
- `Ctrl + C`: press the linked keys together.
- `A _ A _ "done" _ Ctrl + S`: repeated keys, text and a shortcut in order.
- `None`: logical event only.

Operators inside quotes are literal characters. Quoted text supports `\"`, `\\`,
`\n`, `\r`, `\t`. Key names include `Alt+F4`, `Space`, `Left`, `F1`..`F24`,
and `VK:65`; `Plus` names the plus key. Recognized keys/text appear in outlined
boxes; the separate editor scrolls longer previews and blocks invalid expressions.
The former input-level `key` and `keys` fields are rejected; there is no compatibility
reader. Schema v1 remains unsupported.

## Action output modes

The editor's **Action mode** selector is available in Basic and Pro. **Repeat ms**
appears for Repeat. These settings apply to the entire input and are persisted:

```json
"action_mode": "repeat",
"repeat_interval_ms": 375,
"keyboard": [{"keys": [17, 67]}]
```

- **Single press** executes the keyboard sequence once on the accepted trigger.
  Keeping the movement held does not replay it.
- **Hold** executes preceding sequence actions once, then keeps its final shortcut
  pressed until the live trigger conditions end. Thus `Ctrl + C` holds Ctrl and C;
  `"Ready" _ Enter _ Shift` types/sends once, then holds Shift. A nonempty Hold
  sequence must end with a shortcut; text-only Hold is rejected with an error.
- **Repeat** executes the complete sequence immediately, then repeats at the selected
  start-to-start interval while the live conditions remain valid. A running sequence
  always finishes before another repetition starts; delayed ticks never accumulate
  catch-up repetitions. For short intervals, the chord pulse is shortened to half
  the interval (maximum 80 ms), with a gap up to 20 ms. Timing follows the UI timer.

An accepted action stays live while its firing group's High/Low region is currently
occupied and its input/step/local finger rules and Interaction sign remain valid.
Green prerequisites are not revisited during the hold. Without an explicit firing
region, an Ordered final step uses the final Required group in each landmark lane;
Visited/Simultaneous final steps require current occupancy of their Required groups.
Forbidden guards, lost landmarks/signs/fingers, tracking gaps or stale observations
end the activation. A swept trigger with no final occupancy produces a Single press
event but does not start Hold/Repeat. Mirror preserves the activating anatomical hand.
The accepted activation cannot resume output after release without a new trigger.

Stop, Restart, Recalibrate, document replacement, disabling Keyboard, entering Test,
dialogs and stale tracking cancel pending work and release held keys. Test results
can stay highlighted while live output is already inactive. The main input row shows
the selected mode/interval and remains highlighted during a live Hold/Repeat.
Logical recognition events still emit once; portable SDK hosts can consume
`Engine::action_active(index)` or `InputProgress::output_active` to implement their
own output adapters. These runtime flags never enter JSON.

The 27x27 grid has boundaries -9..18, valid cell origins -9..17, and shoulder
anchor [4.5,3.5]. `[x,y]` denotes a unit cell; `[x,y,width,height]` denotes a region.
Coordinates and extents are integers; regions cannot cross the grid boundaries.
The minimum edges are included and maximum edges excluded. Each cell side follows
20% of the current aspect-corrected shoulder width. `body` follows the torso centre
and axis. `calibrated` keeps the calibrated centre and axis while following current
shoulder scale, allowing generic height changes such as Jump and Crouch.
Coordinates are anatomical engine coordinates; the camera preview is mirrored.

## Independent spatial constraints and steps

Each constraint requires input-unique `id`, registered `landmark`, `cell`, `type`
(`required`, `forbidden`, `trigger`, `interaction`), and `priority` (`high`, `low`). Optional fields
are `tolerance_for`, local `fingers`, and `order` (0..1024, default 0).
Interaction requires the additional `interaction` settings object described below.
Spatial overlaps remain independent.

- Required must be visited by the specified landmark.
- Forbidden invalidates the active attempt when crossed, at either priority.
  Whole-movement Forbidden guards apply throughout; step guards apply in that step.
- Interaction is a purple firing region with an explicit hand sign and optional
  continuous hold, described below. It shares the single firing group with Trigger.
- Trigger fires once when its prerequisites are satisfied. Triggers belong to
  steps; at most one High firing group (Trigger or Interaction) is permitted per input. Independent
  unnumbered Triggers each count as a group. In an ordered step,
  Required constraints after the Trigger are follow-through and do not delay firing.
  Later steps do not delay firing either. Without a Trigger, completion fires.
- Low Required/Trigger/Interaction references a same-type, same-landmark High constraint in
  the same scope through `tolerance_for`. It provides an alternative region rather
  than an additional mandatory visit. Low Forbidden may be independent or refer
  to a matching High guard. High constraints cannot reference tolerance targets.

A generic input needs 1..64 steps. Each step requires a unique `id`, nonempty
`constraints`, and at least one High Required, Trigger or Interaction. Optional `mode` defaults
to `visited`; `hold_ms` is 0..1000 (default 0); `fingers` is optional.

| Mode | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `visited` | Required visits accumulate in any order within the step. |
| `simultaneous` | All Required regions must be occupied together. |
| `ordered` | Constraint array order applies independently to each landmark; different landmarks progress in parallel. |

In an ordered step, a positive `order` explicitly numbers a High Required/Trigger
region. Regions with the same **step, anatomical landmark and number** form an
alternative group: reaching any one region validates that number. The numbers
advance in increasing order, independently of their positions in the JSON array.
Different landmarks still have separate lanes and prerequisites. Forbidden and Low
constraints have `order: 0`; Low tolerance continues to reference its own High region.
All members of a numbered group must use the same type. Local finger rules apply
to the actual region visited, including its linked tolerance. Only contacted regions
are highlighted, not the whole row. Multiple numbered yellow regions can form the
single Trigger group.

An entirely unnumbered lane (`order` omitted or 0) retains independent visits in
array order. Mixing numbered and unnumbered High positive constraints in one lane
is rejected. The editor numbers the existing lane when a manual number is chosen.
Switching the step to Visited/Simultaneous explicitly removes its order numbers;
the operation is undoable. Changing Basic/Pro presentation preserves the definition.

For example, a general right-hand raise can use these Required alternatives in
one Ordered step (with unique IDs and High priority on each constraint):

```json
[
  {"id":"bottom_a","landmark":"right_wrist","cell":[1,5],"type":"required","priority":"high","order":1},
  {"id":"bottom_b","landmark":"right_wrist","cell":[2,5],"type":"required","priority":"high","order":1},
  {"id":"top_a","landmark":"right_wrist","cell":[1,3],"type":"required","priority":"high","order":2},
  {"id":"top_b","landmark":"right_wrist","cell":[2,3],"type":"required","priority":"high","order":2}
]
```

One bottom cell followed by one top cell completes the input; there is no need to
traverse each horizontal row. Choose **Order: 1**, draw the bottom row, then
**Order: 2** and draw the top row. A manual numbered brush also reassigns an existing
same-type square without stacking another constraint. Auto retains path numbering;
when a lane is already numbered it allocates subsequent numbers. Forbidden remains X.

Steps progress in array order, at most one step per observation. Input-level
Required visits are accumulated prerequisites; input-level Forbidden is a guard.
Stable finger rules apply alongside spatial requirements. A held Trigger or
completed movement cannot emit repeatedly; normal mode rearms after leaving the
start region. Test results remain locked until Restart. Restart clears progress
without changing calibration; Recalibrate also replaces the body anchor.

The central landmark registry in `mig/core/input.hpp` supports all 33 pose
landmarks, derived `head`, and `left_hand`/`right_hand` aliases for the pose wrists.
Head uses the midpoint of visible ears, falling back to the nose. Names include
`nose`, `left_eye_inner`, `left_eye`, `left_eye_outer` (and right equivalents),
`left_ear`, `right_ear`, `mouth_left`, `mouth_right`, and left/right `shoulder`,
`elbow`, `wrist`, `hand`, `pinky`, `index`, `thumb`, `hip`, `knee`, `ankle`, `heel`,
`foot_index`. Mirror reflects positions about x=4.5 and exchanges anatomical
left/right landmarks and finger hands; head and nose retain their identity.

## Finger scopes and global controls

Each finger rule requires `hand` (`left`/`right`), `finger`
(`thumb`/`index`/`middle`/`ring`/`pinky`), and `pose` (`extended`/`closed`).
Optional `stable_ms` is 50..500 (default 100); `grace_ms` is 0..300 (default 150).
A scope permits at most ten rules and no duplicate hand/finger binding.
`inputs[].fingers` applies throughout the movement, `steps[].fingers` while
advancing that step, and `constraints[].fingers` when validating that region.
An empty list imposes no rule. Extension >=0.7 means extended, <=0.3 closed;
confidence must be >=0.6. Stability must be acquired before grace can bridge a
brief mismatch. Native extension is a joint-angle abstraction; uncertain anatomical
hand assignment is rejected. Human accuracy still requires camera validation.

Application controls are separate from finger input rules. Optional `restart`,
`recalibrate`, and `record_toggle` each contain `gesture`
(`none`/`thumb`/`v`/`ok`/`open_palm`/`fist`)
and `hand` (`left`/`right`). Defaults disable each binding. Thumb requires only
the thumb extended; V requires only index and middle extended. `validation_ms`
is 100..1000 (default 250). `post_gesture_delay_ms` must equal 1000.
The one-second suppression starts at validation, cancels recognition state,
and suppresses recording samples. A held command remains latched; a deliberate
known release is necessary before another activation. Lost hands are not release.
Each gesture/hand pair can bind only one application action; duplicate enabled
bindings are rejected. Choosing a previously assigned sign in the controls editor
removes the other assignment, preventing default Right V recalibration from also
firing when Right V is reassigned to recording.

Global V commands require index/middle >=0.7, ring/pinky <=0.4 and thumb <=0.55
(a partially curled thumb is accepted). Thumb commands retain the strict >=0.7 /
<=0.3 pattern. All five observations must be known. These command tolerances do
not change persisted finger constraints. Command continuity tolerates up to 500 ms
between observations; the app accepts command results up to 500 ms old. Movement
recognition, overlays and keyboard freshness retain the tighter 250 ms limit.
Record toggle requires an open input editor and uses its selected recording
landmarks and coordinate space; the main status and logs expose recognition/recovery.

## Purple Interaction cells

Only `type: "interaction"` requires an `interaction` object. Other constraint
types reject that object. Interaction cells belong to steps and fire the same
logical action/keyboard shortcut as yellow Trigger cells. An input can have at
most one High firing group across both types. Numbered alternatives retain their
own hand/sign/hold settings. Existing finger rules still apply at every scope.

```json
{
  "id": "confirm", "landmark": "left_wrist", "cell": [4, 5],
  "type": "interaction", "priority": "high",
  "interaction": {"hand": "left", "gesture": "ok", "hold_ms": 400}
}
```

`hand` is anatomical `left` or `right`; `gesture` is `thumb`, `v`, `ok`,
`open_palm` or `fist` (`none` is invalid). `hold_ms` is 0..60000 and defaults to
0 (immediate). The designated landmark must currently occupy the region while
the chosen hand matches the sign. Sweeping across the region is insufficient.
The hold starts once the movement's prerequisites and step hold are satisfied.
Leaving the region, losing the sign/observations, missing required landmarks,
stale tracking, Restart or discontinuity resets it. Inputs containing only
Interaction and Forbidden constraints allow up to 500 ms between hand observations;
movement paths and spatial sweep interpolation retain the 180 ms maximum gap.
Keyboard output still requires fresh results (250 ms). An occupied Interaction
region with its matching sign reserves that anatomical hand from global commands,
including while held/cooling down, so a default recalibration binding cannot
interrupt the input. Outside the region, global commands work normally.
Finger rules retain their explicit configured grace period. Low tolerance regions
must inherit the High target's identical Interaction settings; the combined
High/tolerance area shares that target's timer. Each numbered High alternative
has its own timer. Mirror swaps the hand and landmark. The normal release/rearm
latch and input cooldown apply after firing.

OK uses the 3D thumb-tip/index-tip distance divided by palm width (index MCP to
pinky MCP), corrected for image aspect. It requires ratio <=0.25, known contact
confidence >=0.6, and middle/ring/pinky extension >=0.7. Missing or degenerate
palm/contact observations reject OK. Open palm requires all five extensions >=0.7;
Fist requires all five <=0.3. All five fingers must have confidence >=0.6.
These classifiers serve global commands, status and Interaction cells.

In Pro mode, choose the purple **Interaction** brush, then set hand, sign and hold
time in its tab before drawing. Select an existing purple cell and **Update
interaction** to edit it. The **Fingers** tab edits scoped poses and stable/grace
times. Basic mode preserves these definitions while hiding advanced authoring.
Applying/testing an Interaction input enables hand tracking in a hands-enabled build.
In an Ordered step, Auto purple painting/fill groups cells for the same body part
under one number: any matching cell can fire the action. No green/yellow prerequisite
is required. The editor and main input stack show scoped finger/sign counts.

For new wrist regions, the editor defaults the sign's hand to the selected anatomical
wrist. Existing regions retain their explicit hand; select the cell and **Update
interaction** to change it. Left/right always refer to the user's own hands.
Live progress distinguishes missing hand observations, a known sign mismatch,
additional finger-rule mismatch, and a valid hold with elapsed/required milliseconds.
For pure Interaction inputs, input-level finger mismatch resets the hold and waits
for recovery instead of permanently locking the attempt. It never bypasses that rule.

**Details** lists each bound finger, scope, pose, stable/grace time and Interaction
hand/sign/hold alongside the keyboard sequence.

The main sidebar highlights each accepted trigger in green for 900 ms, including
Test events. It is independent of keyboard/log switches, keyed by stable input ID
and never enters JSON. Stop or document replacement clears the highlight.

## Recording, limits and validation

Live multi-landmark recordings remain temporary until explicit conversion/apply.
They sample at most 20 Hz for 60 seconds, synchronously for all selected landmarks.
Review supports moving a point, deleting a synchronized sample, trimming, discarding,
and explicit conversion to simultaneous cell stages. More than 64 cell transitions
requires trimming. The coordinate basis is frozen for the recording session.
Reviewed `recordings` metadata stores `{ "landmark": "head", "points": [[4.5,0.5]] }`;
there are at most 34 traces and 2048 points per trace, finite and within [-9,18).
Saved points are authoring metadata, never implicit recognition rules.

Files are bounded to 1 MiB and nesting depth 32. IDs/names/actions are at most
80 bytes. There are at most 1024 constraints per scope and 4096 per input.
Unknown enums/landmarks, duplicate IDs/bindings, invalid cells, unsupported schema,
misplaced Triggers and inconsistent tolerance references reject the entire load.
Saving validates and replaces atomically. Camera images, highlighted cells,
current steps, gesture latches and live recorder state are never serialized.

## Example: generic Jump

These cells are an editable example rather than a universal user calibration.
Crouch can use the same three landmarks with lower Required regions. There is
no Jump/Crouch branch in the engine.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "tracking": {"hands": false},
  "controls": {
    "restart": {"gesture": "thumb", "hand": "left"},
    "recalibrate": {"gesture": "v", "hand": "right"},
    "record_toggle": {"gesture": "thumb", "hand": "right"},
    "validation_ms": 250,
    "post_gesture_delay_ms": 1000
  },
  "inputs": [{
    "id": "jump", "name": "Jump", "action": "jump", "keyboard": [{"keys": [32]}],
    "mirror": false, "space": "calibrated", "max_duration_ms": 0, "cooldown_ms": 0,
    "steps": [{
      "id": "rise", "mode": "simultaneous",
      "constraints": [
        {"id": "head_high", "landmark": "head", "cell": [4,-2,1,3], "type": "required", "priority": "high"},
        {"id": "left_rise", "landmark": "left_shoulder", "cell": [6,1], "type": "required", "priority": "high"},
        {"id": "right_rise", "landmark": "right_shoulder", "cell": [2,1], "type": "required", "priority": "high"}
      ]
    }]
  }]
}
```

A Low contour entry could be
`{"id":"head_margin","landmark":"head","cell":[5,0],"type":"required","priority":"low","tolerance_for":"head_high"}`
in the same step. To require an extended index at a Trigger, add
`"fingers":[{"hand":"right","finger":"index","pose":"extended"}]`
to that Trigger constraint. To require it throughout, put the list on the input.
## Editor presentation and live scaling

The editor's **View: Body** projects the grid onto its own mirrored inference
image using that snapshot's calibrated/body basis, aspect, centre, axis and current
shoulder scale. Rendered cell width changes with shoulder spacing; it is no longer
normalized to a fixed square. Pointer hit testing uses the inverse of the exact
same projection, including mirror and rotation. A drawing stroke freezes its view
until release so moving shoulders cannot move cells under the pointer mid-stroke.
**View: Full grid** exposes the complete 27x27 authoring area, including zones
outside the camera image. Before calibration this view is also the fallback.
Full grid reflects the horizontal axis exactly once, just like the camera view;
cells, dots, traces and pointer hit testing use the same projection. This does not
alter saved anatomical coordinates or the input's optional recognition Mirror.
The main camera remains unobstructed; body/grid diagnostics belong to the editor.
Theme, Basic/Pro mode, inspector tabs and viewport selection are UI state, not JSON recognition
parameters. Dark/light menus, combo fields, buttons and linked logs use one palette.

The default Basic editor uses one ordered step for a new input. Visible Pencil,
Fill, Tolerance, Eraser and Select buttons operate on the chosen landmark with
green Required, red Forbidden and yellow Trigger paint. Tolerance selects its
High target directly on click, including through its linked Low region; one click
adds a faint Low contour. Select supports rectangular dragging and Ctrl to retain
the previous selection. Deletion also removes the deleted region's linked Low entries.
Pencil/eraser
interpolate between mouse samples, and each stroke remains one Undo operation.
The yellow finish is one movable Trigger. Adding Required cells keeps them before
that finish. Full grid shows centered order numbers per landmark for ordered
steps (step.order for multiple steps), X for Forbidden and R for unordered
Required; Low contours do not introduce additional required visits. The selected
landmark is filled; other landmark layers remain outlined and independently editable.
Pro mode exposes steps, ordering/hold controls, High/Low properties, finger scopes,
recording, coordinate space and optional timing limits. The keyboard shortcut
field is available in both Basic and Pro. Switching
modes preserves the definition, including existing advanced rules.

All drawing tools and paint types now live in the editor sidebar. Its layer stack
groups constraints by anatomical landmark across global guards and all steps.
Layers are a view of existing independent constraints; no second recognition model
or JSON layer array is introduced. Selecting a layer selects the body part; hiding
it changes only presentation. Deleting it removes that landmark's constraints in
all scopes, with one Undo operation. Basic Clear removes the complete drawing;
Pro Clear retains its current-scope behaviour. Help is optional and closes when
drawing begins. Visibility/help/selection never enter the JSON file.
In Basic and Pro, select a stack row, change **Layer body part**, then click
**Save layer**. This changes `landmark` on that layer's spatial constraints in
every scope, preserving IDs, cells, order, tolerance links, finger rules and
Interaction settings. Explicit anatomical finger/sign hands remain unchanged;
review them in Pro when changing hands. Recorded traces retain their original
capture identity and are not reassigned. A body part already used by another layer
is rejected without changing either drawing. The body-part selector is a pending
edit: save it or restore its original value before switching layers, drawing,
applying or testing. Drawing edits otherwise remain in the input draft when switching
layers. Reassignment is one Undo/Redo operation. **Save layer** saves into the draft;
**Apply input** publishes it, and File > Save persists the configuration. No JSON
field is added for the layer editor or its pending selection.
Basic Eraser removes all colours/priorities of the selected body part at the pointer,
across all scopes. Pro Eraser retains the chosen type/priority/current scope.

Normal application startup is an empty configuration, with Right V assigned to
Recalibrate (Hands remains off until enabled). Bundled `configs/default.json` is
an example that must be opened explicitly or passed with `--config`; its three
sample cells are never forced into newly authored inputs. Applying remote bindings
enables Hands and persists the setting. Recalibrate clears calibration/progress
and retains the fixed one-second command recovery and held-gesture latch.

`tracking.hands` also controls whether the bundled browser camera example runs hand inference.
Hosts may still supply explicit hand observations to the positions-only engine.

The visual examples now have separate raised-hands and profile-import entry points.
Profile importers initially use an empty `inputs` array and report the imported
action/id verbatim. A successful import replaces the engine and recalibrates;
failed validation preserves the previous profile. Python performs import and camera
restart on its capture owner thread because successful `mig_load` stops capture.
The C++ examples keep their camera source while replacing the recognition engine.
All camera profile importers follow `tracking.hands` when deciding whether to run
their hand model; raised-hands demos enable it for visualization. Text feedback, profile
file paths and demo/import mode are presentation state, not JSON schema fields.
Native controller/C-ABI capture rejects recognition older than 250 ms using the
current monotonic clock; hosts submitting their own packets own their time source.

React, Vue and Next.js use the same schema-v2 profile through the browser session.
Their profile pages start empty, follow `tracking.hands`, and preserve the active
profile after invalid imports. Successful imports clear displayed actions and
recalibrate without restarting the video stream. Framework, theme, asset URLs and
feedback are host presentation settings; no fields were added to JSON. Accepted
callbacks are logical application events, not desktop key injection or a Hold/
Repeat scheduler. See [JavaScript integration](../integrations/javascript.md).

MIG 1.0.0 uses schema version 2. See [bootstrap](../getting-started/bootstrap.md) and [example code](../getting-started/examples.md).

## Controller profile list

The controller keeps its named profile list in a separate `profiles.json`, with
`version: 1`, `selected` (zero-based index, or -1) and a `profiles` array of
`{ "id": "1", "name": "Game" }` entries. Numeric IDs identify managed files
`1.json`, `2.json`, etc.; these remain normal schema-v2 configurations. The list
is bounded to 64 entries and 64 KiB, names to 256 UTF-8 bytes. Imports and list
updates use atomic replacement. Camera visibility, verification and keyboard consent
are session settings and do not change motion JSON. See [controller](../guides/controller.md).
